## About Me

Hello, welcome to my homepage! My name is Junhui Zhang. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University advised by [Prof. Xiaonan Lu](https://sites.temple.edu/ecexiaonanlu/people/). Meanwhile, I also work closely with [Prof. Wenyuan Tang](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/wtang8/) at North Carolina State University. I got my Ph.D. degree at Applied Mathematics in 2021 from Tongji University advised by [Prof. Jitao Sun](https://math.tongji.edu.cn/info/1147/8803.htm). I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the [Distributed Cooperative Systems Research (DISCOVER) Lab](https://sites.google.com/a/nd.edu/discoverlab/) of University of Notre Dame advised by [Prof. Hai Lin](https://www3.nd.edu/~hlin1/), and the University of Johannesburg advised by [Prof. Qing-Guo Wang](https://www.uj.ac.za/members/prof-qing-guo-wang/) and [Prof. Tshilidzi Marwala](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tshilidzi_Marwala), in 2019 and 2020, respectively. 

My research interests are  **the interplay between control, optimization and machine learning with their applications to decision making in cyber-physical systems and safety-critical systems**. Currently, I am **developing safe, reliable and efficient control, optimization, and machine learning methods for power systems**. I am also interested in the **control of connected automated vehicles and robotics.**
